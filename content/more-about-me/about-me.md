I grew up and attended university (Zhejiang University, ZJU) in Hangzhou (杭州), a poetic and fine city of natural beauty in East China. Before that, I went to Hangzhou No.4 High School (杭州第四中学), Cuiyuan Middle School (翠苑中学), and Sandunzhen Central Elementary School (三墩镇中心小学).

During my undergraduate, the best times that I had are outside my lovely home university, which is kind enough to allow and (financially) support me wonder about other parts of the world. I first traveled to Trento University, Italy, for one semester supported by [ERASMUS+](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/studying-abroad_en). Then I went for a [Mitacs Globalink](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink) summer internship at York University, Cananda, hosted by professor [Gerd Grau](http://eecs.lassonde.yorku.ca/faculty/gerd-grau/). Immediately after that, I participated in a leadership programme---[Master Kong Dream Scholarship Programme](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/cie/en/to-waseda/masterkong)---at Waseda University, Japan, supervised by professor [Sachiko HIRAKAWA](https://www.waseda.jp/prj-wiccs/english/member/4346).

Academically, I first studied computational fluid dynamics. At York University, I worked on simulating the hydrodynamically focused printing process. At Waseda University, I was exposed to public policy and studied Japanese government's measures against Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). After that, I worked on semantic segmentation of satellite images at the [State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics](http://www.sio.org.cn/english/redir.php?catalog_id=82193), which became my undergraduate thesis.

My interests include travel, skiing, and basketball. I enjoy wine, especially with friends (what's the point of drinking alone??). I love musical & opera. My favorates are les miserables and Hamilton (don't ask me to sing or you will be disappointed).

I believe in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. I am committed to promote these values.
