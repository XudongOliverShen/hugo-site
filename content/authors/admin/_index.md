Hi! My name is Xudong Shen (沈旭东 in Chinese). Friends also call me Oliver. I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at National Univeristy of Singapore. I study machine learning with a focus on people and society. Topics include *fairness* and *bias* in machine learning. My advisor is professor [Mohan Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/). I can be reached at xudong-shen@u-nus-edu (replace hyphens with dots). My cv is [here](files/cv.pdf).

Between 2015 and 2019, I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University, China. The research areas that I have had the chance to work on are computational fluid dynamics, hydrodynamically focused printing, satellite remote sensing, and public policy. During my undergraduate study, I had some of the best times at Trento University (Italy), Waseda University (Japan), and York University (Canada). I am fortunate to have been supervised/advised by professor [Sachiko HIRAKAWA](https://www.waseda.jp/prj-wiccs/english/member/4346), professor [Gerd Grau](http://eecs.lassonde.yorku.ca/faculty/gerd-grau/), and professor [Gang Zheng](http://www.sio.org.cn/redir.php?catalog_id=1319&object_id=311131).

I believe in Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. I am committed to promote these values.

If you are interested, I've written something [more about myself](more-about-me/)...
